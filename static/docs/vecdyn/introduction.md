## What is VecDyn?

VecDyn is a global database for spatially and temporally explicit presence-absence and abundance data. We accept and distribute data for animal and plant disease vectors. 
Arthropods play a dominant role in natural and human-modified terrestrial ecosystem dynamics. Spatially-explicit arthropod population time-series data are crucial for statistical or mathematical models of thes dynamics and assessment of their veterinary, medical, agricultural, and ecological impacts. Such data have been collect world-wide for over a century, but remain scattered and largely inaccessible. Our mission is to collect and standardise vector population data and make it available for the scientific community  

### Database Usage

- **Abundance data**: Tracking populations over time and space
- **Presence absence data**: Tracking species presence / absence over time and space
- **Point location data**: Tracking Geo-point locations of where a species was observed at a particular point in time. 

### Overview of data collection

- **What** – description of the sample collected – (e.g. species, count)
- **When** –  temporal information about time of collection. 
- **Where** – geographical information about where the collection took place. 
- **How** – operational information about how the collections were made. 
- **Who**  – who has responsibility for the collection
