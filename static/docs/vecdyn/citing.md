## 

There are many different reference formats and reference managers that handle data-set and database citations differently. The following points provide you with instructions of how to site the data-sets and the VecDyn database in APA.

1. State the creator, owner, or collection organization first. This might be an organization, university, company, or governmental body. This information is found in the 'collection_author.name' field in your data file.
2. Write the title of the database i.e. *VecDyn* in italics
3. Place the word “database” in brackets next to the title. This tells the reader that this citation is a database. After the second bracket, place a period (known as a full stop in British English).
4. Add the URL or DOI at the end of the citation. Write the words “retrieved from” before adding the link [www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn](https://www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn)

The final citation might look like:

Mosquito surveillance from the Toledo Area Sanitary District program to survey mosquito populations. *VecDyn* [database]. Retrieved from [www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn](https://www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn).

VecDyn data is often made up of long time series data that is submitted at different time intervals, often annually. Therefore it is not often appropriate to site a publication year. However, you could add the year you accessed the database if required. Furthermore, if you are combining a number of Vecdyn data-sets in a study, you should provide a reference for each creator, owner, or collection organization (point 1).
