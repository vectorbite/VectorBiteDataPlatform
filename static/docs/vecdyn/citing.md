# Citing VecDyn data

The following points provide you with instructions of how to site the data-sets and the VecDyn database in APA.

1. State the creator, owner, or collection organisation first. For example, this might be a university, company, or governmental body. This information is found in the 'collection_author.name' field in your data file.
2. Write the title of the database i.e. *VecDyn* in italics
3. Place the word “database” in brackets next to the title. This tells the reader that this citation is a database. After the second bracket, place a period (known as a full stop in British English).
4. Add the URL or DOI at the end of the citation. Write the words “retrieved from” before adding the link [www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn](https://www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn)

The final citation might look like:

Mosquito surveillance from the Toledo Area Sanitary District program to survey mosquito populations. *VecDyn* [database]. Retrieved from [www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn](https://www.vectorbyte.org/vecdyn).

VecDyn data is often made up of long time series data that is submitted at different time intervals, often annually. Therefore it is not often appropriate to site a publication year. However, if required, you could cite the year you accessed the database. Furthermore, if you are combining a number of VecDyn data-sets in a study, you should provide a reference for each creator, owner, or collection organisation (point 1).
