Global **Vec**tor Population **Dyn**amics Database (VecDyn)
Documentation
================

# Introduction

Welcome to VectorBiTE’s VecDyn database guidelines. This document
provides details and instructions on accessing and submitting data. You
can also access data collection templates and examples which will help
you with preparing data for submission.

## What is VecDyn?

VecDyn is a global database for spatially- and temporally- explicit
population presence-absence abundance, density and dynamics data. We
accept and distribute data for both animal and plant disease vectors.

## Obtaining data from VecDyn

To get access to VecDyn’s open data, all you need to do is:

1.  Sign up via the [VectorBiTE Data Platform Web
    App](http://vectorbyte.org) and log in.

2.  To query data, on the index page, click on the ‘Get data’ button and
    then ‘VecDyn’ button to open up the population data search facility.

3.  To query data, either enter a species or geographical location.
    Please note that the search facility is case sensitive.

4.  To download data, just click on the selection box beside a data set
    title, then click on the ‘Download Selected’ button.

*All data is downloaded in text/csv format.* *Note that the current
search facility is temporary and we’ll soon be implementing a range of
new features to help you search and visualise data.*

## Submitting data

*To submit data to the VecDyn database, follow the subsequent
guidelines*

1.  Download the latest template here by right clicking on the following
    [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Template%26Scripts/VecDyn_template.csv).and
    selecting ‘save.as’.  
    A completed [example data
    set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Examples/ManateeCountyMosquitoMonitoring/vecdyn_manatee_county_aedes_aegypti.csv)
    can be found here. This will help you to understand how to compile
    data in the VecDyn template format. You can also access an example
    [R Markdown
    recipe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Examples/ManateeCountyMosquitoMonitoring/ManateeCountryMosquitoMonitoring.Rmd)
    here. This guide takes you through the steps of converting an
    existing data set into a VecDyn dataset using the VecDyn template.
    Notice that all files are in plain text e.g. ‘.csv’ format, and not
    in Excel format or similar. This facilitates text parsing by
    scripts, prevents data loss/corruption, and allows for detailed
    comparisons of changes via version control systems.

2.  You can refer to the [VecDyn Data Collection
    Specifications](#vecdyn-data-collection-specifications) to guide you
    through the data collection and compilation process.

3.  All data submissions are curated through Zenodo, an open access and
    open data platform. [Follow this
    link](https://zenodo.org/deposit/new?c=vecdyn) to get access to our
    submission page.

4.  To submit your dataset, upload the completed VecDyn Template on
    Zenodo. Under ‘Upload type’ select ‘data set’ and fill in all the
    fields under ‘Basic information’, ‘License’ and ‘Funding’. By
    submitting your data through Zenodo, there is no need to send us the
    basic ‘Data Series Information’ separately since this will be
    covered through the Zenodo submission.

5.  We’ll contact you regarding the outcome of your submission once
    we’ve had a look at it.

## Adding data to the database (*Curators only*)

For testing purposes (*temporary*) first download the [example data
set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Examples/ManateeCountyMosquitoMonitoring/vecdyn_manatee_county_aedes_aegypti.csv)
to try out the process.

Log on and go to the web app and go to [my
collections](https://vectorbiteonlineplatform.pythonanywhere.com/VectorBiteDataPlatform/vecdyn/my_collections).

Click on **‘Add New
Collection’**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

The first table captures general information about the data provider and
the data series. A data series may provide centralised information about
one or many related
datasets.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep2.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Once the collection information has been registered, you now be able to
submit data sets to that collection. Click o ‘Add new data set to
collection’

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep3.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next select a taxon, it is best to search using the first box first.
When you have found the taxon you are after. Hit the ‘select’ button on
the aligning
row.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep4.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next select a geographical location, this either needs to be country or
an Adm1 (e.g. State) or adm2 (county) administrative subdivision. Again,
Hit the ‘select’ button on the aligning ror of your
choice.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep5.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next submit all the study data (metadata) and click on submit once you
have completed the
page.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep6.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next you need to upload the complete csv. This will only upload fields
related to the time series (sample
data)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep7.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Once completed, you’ll be taken the final page where you can see all the
sample data relating to the study data. From here you can verify all the
information is correct. If it click on ‘finish’ to be take back the
collections
page.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/master/static/Documentation/VecDyn/Images/DataUploadStep9.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

However, if these is a problem you can delete or edit each entry. To
delete all the entries hit ‘select’ all and scroll down to the bottom of
the page and click ‘delete
selected’

The next table captures metadata for a study. A study should be regarded
as a set of data for one single species, at a given location over a
specific time period. The metadata should be used to capture information
like the general location of a study and particular methods or equipment
used to collect data on the study organism. Note that data entered into
these fields should be repeated for each time series row/observation. In
effect, the metadata helps to describe the time series
data.

In the following table, the next set of variables captures the
information required to produce a time-Series dataset. Each row should
represent a separate observation, at a particular point in time. Note

# Data Standardization

## Standardizing Taxonomy

To standardise taxonomy, VecDyn includes the [The Catalogue of Life
database](http://www.catalogueoflife.org), which is the most
comprehensive and authoritative global index of species currently
available. Taxonomic data will be standardised by curators upon the
addition of a dataset to the VecDyn database.

| Field Name           | Name in DB                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| taxonID              | taxonID                   |
| kingdom              | tax\_kingdom              |
| phylum               | tax\_phylum               |
| class                | tax\_class                |
| order                | tax\_order                |
| superfamily          | tax\_superfamily          |
| family               | tax\_family               |
| genus                | tax\_genus                |
| subgenus             | tax\_subgenus             |
| specificEpithet      | tax\_specificEpithet      |
| infraspecificEpithet | tax\_infraspecificEpithet |
| species              | tax\_species              |

## Standardizing Geo Referencing

In order to standardise geographic information, the [the Global
Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) 2014
databaset](http://www.fao.org/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=12691)
has been incorporated into the VecDyn database. The GAUL database
systematises global administrative regions with a unified coding system
at country, first (e.g. departments) and second administrative levels
(e.g. districts). Each Administrative unit is assigned a unique ID and
is connected to a spatial polygon. Therefore data submitted to the
VecDyn database can be represented spatially, as long as a minimal set
of information is provided by the submitter e.g. country, county,
region,
state.

| Field Name in db    | Description                                                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ADM\_CODE           | unique code assigned to each administrative unit / shape file        |
| ADM0\_NAME          | country name                                                         |
| ADM1\_NAME          | first administrative subdivision e.g. Florida                        |
| ADM2\_NAME          | first administrative subdivision e.g. Manatee County                 |
| centroid\_latitude  | latitude of centroid representing centre of administrative unit      |
| centroid\_longitude | longitude centroid taking representing centre of administrative unit |

## Standardizing Environmental Descriptions

Environmental descriptors can be standardized using
[ENVO](http://environmentontology.org/Browse-EnvO). ENVO is an ontology
which represents knowledge about environments,environmental processes,
ecosystems, habitats, and related
entities.

# Issues, troubleshooting & suggestions

Any suggestions or todos with regards to the database (e.g. new columns,
schema modifications etc.) can be logged as [Issues on
GitHub](https://github.com/vectorbite/VectorBiteDataPlatform/issues).
Issues allow for discussions among multiple users, file attachments,
colour-coded labels etc.

## Known isses

The FAO’s GUAL data set has been restructured for VecDyn. A new column
was created which represents an individual ID for each admin unit. This
creates a few minor issues, since some region codes are not unique and
therefore, an additional ‘b’ has been added to the end of
each’ADM\_CODE’ which has been used in VecDyn as a ‘Primary
key’

| ADM\_CODE  | ADM2\_NAME                        | ADM1\_NAME   | ADM0\_NAME                  |

# Miscellaneous

The `GPDD` directory also contains the documentation of the [**G**lobal
**P**opulation **D**ynamics
**D**atabase](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/cpb/databases/gpdd), a
pre-existing database of population dynamics, hosted in Silwood Park,
Imperial College London since 1999. VecDyn aims to learn from both
GPDD’s success and potential shortcomings as it moves forward.
